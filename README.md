### Global Dual Sourcing Strategy Analysis

#### Overview
This project explores a global dual sourcing strategy to maximize financial outcomes by strategically sourcing from Mexico and China. We simulate different scenarios to identify optimal inventory and cash flow management strategies for a supply chain dealing in units priced at $10 each, with sourcing costs varying between the two countries.

#### Key Components
- **Data Analysis**: The analysis uses simulated demand distributions to calculate reorder points (ROP) and safety stock (SS) under different service levels, optimizing the supply chain's responsiveness and cost efficiency.
- **Sourcing Strategies**:
  - **Mexico**: Short lead times with higher unit costs.
  - **China**: Longer lead times with lower unit costs.
- **Financial Modeling**: Incorporates financial rates where cash earns 1% per period, and debt costs 1% per period, with a starting cash balance of $0.

#### Key Findings
- **Service Level Impact**: Analysis under different service levels shows how they significantly affect inventory levels, cash balance, and overall financial stability.
- **Dual Sourcing Benefits**:
  - Enhanced inventory management by leveraging short-term responsiveness from Mexico and cost-effective bulk ordering from China.
  - Improved cash flow management through careful balancing of sales revenue and order costs, including interest and debt management.
  
#### Simulation Results
- **Inventory and Cash Flow Plots**: Visualizations of inventory levels and cash balances for both countries, using a log scale for better clarity on trends.
- **Financial Outcomes**: The dual sourcing strategy generally results in better financial outcomes compared to single sourcing, with significant improvements in operational efficiency and scalability.

#### Conclusion
The dual sourcing strategy provides a robust framework for optimizing supply chain operations, demonstrating superior financial results and improved supply chain responsiveness.
